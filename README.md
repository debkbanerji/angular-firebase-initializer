# Angular Firebase Initializer

An initializer for creating Firebase applications with authentication and realtime database support using [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2).

Made with â™¥ by Deb Banerji

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Building The Project

In order to build the project, you will need both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the Node Package Manager (which can be installed alongside Node.js).

You will also need the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) which can be installed through npm by running the following command:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Using `-g` will install the command line interface globally, allowing you to use the `ng` command, which is required to run the development server, as well as build the project.

After you have installed npm, run `npm install` in order to install the remaining dependencies.

## Running The Project

In order to run the application, use `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Using The Angular CLI

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Note that this will not start the backend, so unless you are only working with the frontend, you should instead use `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
